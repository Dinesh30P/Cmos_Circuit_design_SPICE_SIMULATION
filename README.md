# Lecture 1: Why is SPICE Simulation needed?

- To verify circuit behavior before fabrication
-  To optimize the Performance
-  To reduce the Cost and improve time efficiency

The circuit shown above is a CMOS inverter, which represents the simplest form of a digital logic gate. 
most of the time,it can function to implement the NOT operation.
By altering the pull‑down (PDN) and pull‑up (PUN) networks, different logic gates can be constructed. 
When various input signals are applied to these circuits, their output behavior can be analyzed, and the corresponding I‑V characteristic curves are obtained as illustrated below.
