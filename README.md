# CMOS_Circuit_design_&_SPICE_SIMULATION

# L1: Why is SPICE Simulation needed?
- To verify circuit behavior before fabrication
-  To optimize the Performance
-  To reduce the Cost and improve timing efficiency 

## Why we need SPICE  
- Spice is a Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis

- The circuit shown above is a CMOS inverter, which represents the simplest form of a digital logic gate. 
- most of the time,it can function to implement the NOT operation.
- By altering the pull‑down (PDN) and pull‑up (PUN) networks, different logic gates can be constructed. 
- When various input signals are applied to these circuits, their output behavior can be analyzed, and the corresponding I‑V characteristic curves are obtained as illustrated below.
